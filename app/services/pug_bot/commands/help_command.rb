The structure for the join command is as follows:

?join Battlenet Region PugType Captain[optional]

If you leave any out, you will be unable to join the pug.

The order is important, and so is spelling!

You can leave off 'Captain' if you don't wish to be a captain.
          ```
        """
      end

      def leave
        """
```
The structure for the leave command is as follows:

?leave Region PugType

If you leave any out, the pug you're trying to leave won't be found.

The order is important, and so is spelling!
```
        """
      end

      def sub
        """
```
If you wish to become a sub for a region/type PUG, you can register for a total of two hours. Pings for subs are on a first come first serve basis. If you miss your ping, you will be passed over and will need to re-register.

The format is as follows:

?sub Battlenet Region PugType

Spelling is important, and so is order!
```
        """
      end

      def sub_request
        """
```
Specify a region and a pug type to get the battlenet of a player who has registered for pugs.

They'll receive a DM that you're looking to have them sub!

A certain amount of time to wait for the player to respond is likely, so give them the benefit of the doubt.

If you re-request, it'll take the next available PUG, but again, you should try to give the first sub a chance to come back.

The format is as follows:

?sub-request Region PugType
```
        """
      end

      def list_members
        """
        ```
This will give you a current list of players in the PUG.

If you specify a region and a type, it will get the unfinished PUG for that classification.

If you don't specify AND you're in a PUG, it will get the list for the PUG you're in.

?list-members [optional] Region PugType
```
        """
      end

      def list_pugs
        """
        ```
This will give you a current list of all the PUGs that are currently not fully registered.


?list-pugs

      def remove_member
        """
        ```
This command is usable by PUG staff and Mods only.

It forcibly removes a member of a pug from the registration, if they're afk or banned from joining PUGs.

If you replace Region and PugType with the word 'all' - it will remove all of the selected user's registrations.

?remove-member DiscordTag [optional]|all] Region PugType

        ```
This command is usable by PUG staff and Mods only.

It disbands a PUG grouping and removes the registrations.

?clear-pug Region PugType
